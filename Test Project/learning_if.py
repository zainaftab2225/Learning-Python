Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user
and print if it is positive, negative, or zero.
Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't just use three if statements.

number = float(input("Enter your number: "))

if number == 0:
    print("Number is 0.")
elif number > 0:
    print("Number is positive.")
else:
    print("Number is negative.")
